Dark Patterns Repository
Overview
The Dark Patterns Repository catalogues deceptive design techniques commonly found in digital interfaces. It helps users recognize manipulative practices, fostering awareness and supporting research. The repository is designed to assist developers, researchers, and users in understanding and addressing interface manipulation in digital contexts.

Abstract
Dark patterns are deceptive design strategies used by websites and apps to push users into unintended actions, such as making purchases or sharing personal information. Addressing dark patterns is crucial as they:

Confuse users
Erode trust
Create frustrating and manipulative online experiences
By combating these unethical tactics, we aim to foster transparent, fair digital environments that respect user choices and enhance trust across the web.

Social Proofing: Fake indications of popularity or demand.
Disguised Ads: Ads disguised as normal content.
Nagging: Repetitive prompts that pressure users into actions.
Confirm Shaming: Guilt-inducing language to push users into opting in.
Fake Urgency: Timers that create false time pressure.
False Scarcity: Manipulating product availability.
Phantom Pricing: Artificial discounts or price manipulation.
